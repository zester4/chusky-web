# Chusky Frontend

## Overview

The frontend is a Next.js application in `chusky-web/`. It contains the public
Chusky marketing site and a product dashboard prototype for managing the Chusky
agent.

The frontend was pushed separately from the parent agent repository:

- Remote: `https://github.com/zester4/chusky-web.git`
- Branch: `codex/chusky-web`
- Commit: `dcf35df` (`Build Chusky product frontend`)

The parent `tg-agent` repository changes were not included in that push.

## What was completed

### Public website

The existing public pages remain available:

- `/` — landing page
- `/features` — feature overview
- `/how-it-works` — product flow
- `/developers` — developer information
- `/pricing` — pricing page
- `/start-creating` — call to action / signup entry
- `/sign-in` — sign-in entry page

### Product dashboard

The new authenticated-product-style shell and pages were added under `/app`.
The current implementation uses local demo data and client-side interactions so
the complete interface can be explored before the backend is connected.

- `/app` — dashboard overview, activity, quick actions, and system status
- `/app/chat` — chat workspace for interacting with Chusky
- `/app/conversations` — conversation list and conversation state
- `/app/approvals` — pending risky-action approvals with approve/deny controls
- `/app/apps` — connected applications and integrations
- `/app/tasks` — task list and task status
- `/app/reminders` — one-time reminders
- `/app/jobs` — recurring jobs and schedules
- `/app/memory` — saved memories and preferences
- `/app/scratchpad` — private temporary notes
- `/app/triggers` — external app triggers
- `/app/workspace` — workspace information and usage
- `/app/devices` — connected CLI/device sessions
- `/app/settings` — account and product settings

The app shell includes responsive navigation, a mobile menu, page headings,
status badges, cards, buttons, and a consistent Chusky visual system.

## Files added or changed

### New product routes

- `chusky-web/app/app/layout.tsx` — product-area layout and app shell wrapper
- `chusky-web/app/app/page.tsx` — dashboard route
- `chusky-web/app/app/[section]/page.tsx` — dynamic product-section route

### New product components

- `chusky-web/components/app/app-shell.tsx` — responsive sidebar, header,
  navigation, shared layout primitives, and status UI
- `chusky-web/components/app/app-pages.tsx` — dashboard and product-section
  page implementations, demo data, and local interactions

### Frontend configuration

- `chusky-web/package.json` — uses webpack explicitly for reliable local builds
- `chusky-web/pnpm-lock.yaml` — includes the Windows Lightning CSS native package

The public-site files and shared styling remain in the existing `chusky-web/app/`
and `chusky-web/components/` structure.

## How to run it locally

From PowerShell:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\mseyy\Downloads\tg-agent\chusky-web
pnpm install
pnpm dev -- -p 3010
```

Open [http://localhost:3010/app](http://localhost:3010/app).

If port 3000 is free, `pnpm dev` can be used and the dashboard will be at
`http://localhost:3000/app`.

From the repository root, `npm run dashboard` starts the same Next.js app in
one command. Operations is at `/app/operations`; Delivery is at `/app/delivery`.

## Verification completed

- Production build completed successfully with `pnpm run build`.
- Verified HTTP 200 responses for `/app`, `/app/chat`, `/app/approvals`, and
  `/app/settings`.
- Verified the frontend diff with `git diff --check`.
- The smooth-scroll warning from Next.js is informational and does not prevent
  the application from running.

## What is left

### Backend and authentication integration

- Add real authentication and protected dashboard access.
- Add a typed API client for the Chusky service.
- Connect the dashboard to the existing Redis-backed sessions, histories,
  memories, approvals, reminders, jobs, scratchpad, triggers, and device data.
- Connect the chat page to the shared Chusky agent/API flow and streaming or
  polling responses.
- Replace local approval actions with server-side approval records and the
  existing one-time, expiring approval rules.
- Add loading, empty, error, retry, optimistic-update, and unauthorized states
  for every data-driven page.

### Product functionality

- Implement create, edit, cancel, delete, and search actions for the relevant
  resources.
- Add real app connection and OAuth/linking flows for supported integrations.
- Add channel management for Telegram, Slack, WhatsApp, and future channel
  adapters while preserving Chusky account ownership and conversation scope.
- Add device pairing, token revocation, and last-seen status for CLI devices.
- Add account/profile management and persistent settings.

### Production readiness

- Define and document the frontend/backend API contract.
- Configure environment variables without committing secrets.
- Add frontend unit/component tests and end-to-end tests for authentication,
  chat, approvals, and CRUD flows.
- Run the complete repository checks, including `npm test`, typecheck, and the
  backend build, after API integration.
- Deploy the frontend and configure its production domain, HTTPS, CORS, and
  backend URL.
- Add observability, rate-limit handling, accessibility review, and responsive
  browser testing.

## Authentication integration

Better Auth is now wired between the Hono backend and the Next.js frontend.

Backend files:

- `src/auth.ts` — Better Auth configuration, SQLite database, Redis secondary
  storage, session policy, password policy, CSRF/origin protections, and startup
  migrations
- `src/authRoutes.ts` — `/api/auth/*` Hono route, CORS, and `/api/auth/ok`
- `src/auth-email.ts` — Resend verification and password-reset email delivery
- `src/config.ts` — auth enablement, trusted origins, and database settings
- `src/index.ts` — auth route registration in webhook and local polling modes

Frontend files:

- `chusky-web/lib/auth-client.ts` — Better Auth browser client
- `chusky-web/components/app/authenticated-app.tsx` — session gate for `/app`
- `chusky-web/components/app/app-shell.tsx` — sign-out action
- `chusky-web/components/landing/auth-pages.tsx` — real sign-in, sign-up,
  recovery, reset, and verification client calls
- `chusky-web/.env.example` — `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_URL`

### Local configuration

Set these variables in the backend `.env`:

```env
BETTER_AUTH_ENABLED=true
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=<a unique value with at least 32 characters>
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:8080
# Include the port used by your frontend. Next.js defaults to 3000; use 3010
# only when you start it with `pnpm dev -- -p 3010`.
BETTER_AUTH_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3010
BETTER_AUTH_DATABASE=./data/better-auth.sqlite
BETTER_AUTH_REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION=true
```

Set this in `chusky-web/.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

Start the backend and frontend separately, then visit `/sign-up`. In local
development, email delivery is accepted but logged as unconfigured unless
`RESEND_API_KEY` and `AUTH_EMAIL_FROM` are set. Production requires both values;
the server refuses to silently skip auth email delivery in production.

The root Better Auth API is intentionally opt-in. If
`BETTER_AUTH_ENABLED=false`, the existing Telegram polling behavior remains
unchanged and auth routes return no authenticated service behavior.

## Backend-connected pages

The first-party dashboard now uses the authenticated Chusky `/v1` API without
exposing `CHUSKY_API_KEY` in the browser:

- `chusky-web/lib/chusky-api.ts` — typed, credentialed client for threads,
  streamed runs, tasks, and usage; it handles NDJSON streaming, idempotency
  keys, API errors, and session cookies.
- `chusky-web/components/app/chat-page.tsx` — creates/loads a thread and sends
  prompts to `/v1/threads/:id/runs/stream`, rendering tool activity, approval
  requests, failures, cancellation, and streamed assistant text.
- `chusky-web/components/app/backend-pages.tsx` — live overview metrics,
  recent conversations, conversation listing, and task listing with loading,
  empty, offline, and retry states.
- `chusky-web/components/app/app-pages.tsx` — routes Overview, Chat,
  Conversations, and Tasks to the backend-connected page components.
- `chusky-web/components/app/operations-dashboard.tsx` — live Operations and
  Delivery pages for Redis/QStash/Sendblue readiness, enabled channels,
  workflow/provider/delivery failure counters, and the latest runtime incident.
- `chusky-web/components/app/app-shell.tsx` — adds `/app/operations` and
  `/app/delivery` to the authenticated workspace navigation.
- `src/sdkApi.ts` — exposes the authenticated `GET /v1/ops/health` diagnostics
  endpoint without returning provider secrets.
- `src/index.ts` — expands public `/health` with Redis, QStash, Sendblue,
  channel, and failure-monitoring status.
- `src/monitoring.ts` — records structured workflow, delivery, provider, and
  Redis failures for the live dashboard and logs.
- `chusky-web/components/app/account-pages.tsx` — replaces demo-only account
  pages with real persisted approvals, channels, reminders, jobs, memories,
  scratchpad notes, triggers, devices, workspace state, settings, and webhook
  data, including truthful empty/offline states and approval decisions.
- `src/store.ts` — refuses in-memory persistence in production or webhook mode;
  Redis must be configured and reachable.
- `src/cli/setup.ts` — makes `chusky doctor` print remote provider checks and
  runtime failure counts.
- `src/sdkApi.ts` — accepts the Better Auth session for first-party web
  requests, maps the auth user to an isolated `web` project namespace, and
  continues to support project-key SDK clients. It also exposes the scoped
  `GET /v1/account/overview` resource used by the account pages.
- `src/index.ts` — mounts `/v1` when Better Auth is enabled in both local
  polling and hosted webhook modes.

The public `/v1` files, webhook, and audit endpoints are available in the
backend contract but are not yet surfaced by the browser client. Runtime
failure counters are process-local for now; durable workflow state and the
Redis fail-closed startup guard remain authoritative.
